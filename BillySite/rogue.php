                        Sniffing is a way attackers capture a victims data as its send offer a Wi-Fi network.

                        <p><b>Rogue Access Points</b><br>
                        Cybercriminals can set up their own public Wi-Fi network to try and get victims to connect. After connecting their laptop to the internet they then create a hotspot calling it something like 'free_wifi'. Once youth victim connects they are effectively connected to the attackers computer and all the data you send and receive can be captured.
